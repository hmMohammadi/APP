                <p>Strong winds are benefiting Moana 2 as it sails into shore.</p>
                <p>The Walt Disney Animation Studios tentpole set records Monday in terms of first-day advance ticket sales, according to online retailer Fandango.</p>
                <p>It sold more tickets than any other 2024 animated film, including fellow Disney/Pixar summer 2024 blockbuster Inside Out 2. It’s also the fourth-best showing of the year for any movie behind Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Dune: Part 2. (It’s no wonder why box office observers have bequeathed the sequel with its own special moniker: “Moanapocalpyse.”)</p>
                <p>The event pic hits theaters Nov. 27, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and five days after Paramount’s Gladiator II and Universal’s Wicked open in North America. Theater owners are counting on the trio of highly anticipated tentpoles to shore up ticket sales after a tough start to the third quarter.</p>
